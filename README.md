# Bingo Boy
*A silly bot made for mods to have their own server-wide bingo cards*

## Features

### Bot-compatible template included

This bot comes with an easily accessible template under `/template`. Just download the template, fill out the squares, and `/register` it- it's that simple!

### Multiple bingo boards
Servers are allowed to have multiple boards, each with a given name. This way you can keep a "verification mess-ups" board along with your "server raid shenanigans" board :)

### Bingo highlighting

Who wants bingo without fun highlights? This bot will highlight each bingo win on your board in a nice, cool green. If you get a full (/blackout) board, you'll get a special highlight for that!

### Board randomization

Finished a board and want to go again? Giving the board a reset for the new year? No problem! BB is able to give you a randomized board layout whenever you'd like. This will completely clear any existing chips and give you a new board with a new layout. Just make sure all the text fits in right boxes before doing it!
